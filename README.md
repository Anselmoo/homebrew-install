# [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) _[tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps)_ for Dracula

Homebrew _[formulae](https://docs.brew.sh/Cask-Cookbook)_ to easily install Dracula themes.

## Install

Easily install themes from [dracula/homebrew-install](./Casks):

``` sh
brew tap dracula/install
brew install --cask dracula-foo
```

Also, if you keep a [_Brewfile_](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle#usage), you can add something like this:

``` rb
# ~/.Brewfile
tap "dracula/install"
cask "dracula-foo"
```
